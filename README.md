Code for using one push button to control as many states as you want by Long OR Short presses

This code came about as a need to allow people with some physical disability to change the flight mode on a radio control helicopter
by using a button press situated on top of a joystick. The code allows a short push an the button to increase the mode state, a long press to decrease the mode state.

I have left options in the code to develop it further OR to use 'as is' with all ofthe normal disclaimers as to use and so on.

I have also included some ideas of how to develop this so that it can be used as a learing tool if the desire is there.

Is the code perfect, haha, no but it works and it is commented.

I hope you enjoy it and share with others how you have taken this further.
